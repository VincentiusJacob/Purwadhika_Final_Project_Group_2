Arhamuzzaky Alfa
Artificial Intelligence Engineer | Digital Marketing Communications
Specialist at Vanaya Indonesia
South Jakarta, Jakarta, Indonesia
Summary
I’m Arhamuzzaky, a Mentari Intercultural School Jakarta graduate
and an incoming Computer Science student at Monash University
Malaysia. I’m currently expanding my skills at Purwadhika Digital
Technology School, where I’m learning artificial intelligence; from
machine learning to LLMs and Computer Vision.
My passion for coding stems from the same roots that sprouted my
love for arts and creativity: the ability to bring my ideas to life with my
own two hands. 
I'm also working part-time as a Digital Marketing Communications
Specialist at Vanaya Indonesia, developing its social media and
online marketing campaigns.
